Twitter Importer
===================

This is a Camlistore importer for Twitter.

To use:

1) Visit https://apps.twitter.com/ and "Create a new app" to get an API key and
	secret. Note that you *must* specify a callback URL in the application
	settings UI. It doesn't matter what this URL is because Camlistore
	overrides it at runtime. It just has to be some valid non-localhost URL.

2) Start the devcam server with twitterapikey flag:
	$ devcam server -twitterapikey=<apikey>:<secret>

3) Navigate to http://<server>/importer-twitter/login

4) Watch import progress on the command line
